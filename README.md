# CS 1.6 ReHLDS Server Lab

A Counter-Strike 1.6 GoldSrc public-session experiment built with **GitHub Actions + Playit + Vercel only**.

There is no Oracle VM, VPS, home computer, or separately rented game host in this design.

## Verified game stack

**Local GitHub Actions smoke test passed on 2026-11-07:**
- ReHLDS 3.15.0.896-dev.
- Metamod-R 1.3.0.149.
- ReUnion 0.2.0.25, shown as `RUN` in `meta list`.
- GoldSrc protocol 48.
- `de_dust2` reached `Round_Start`.

This proves the engine and plugin stack can start on a GitHub-hosted Linux runner. It does not yet prove public UDP reachability or that 20–32 real players can be sustained.

## The three services

- **GitHub Actions:** starts a temporary Linux runner, installs the server, and runs one public session.
- **Playit:** forwards public UDP traffic to the runner's local `127.0.0.1:27015`.
- **Vercel:** serves the public status page only. It does not run the game server.

## Self-healing server session

The workflow `.github/workflows/cs16-public-session.yml` uses an in-session watchdog, not a recurring schedule. Once triggered, it checks ReHLDS and the Playit agent every 10 seconds and restarts either process if it exits unexpectedly.

The runner session is deliberately bounded to 5 hours 40 minutes, with the complete GitHub job capped at six hours. The watchdog can revive the game-server and tunnel processes while that runner is alive. It cannot resurrect a GitHub runner after GitHub ends the job or bypass GitHub's execution limit. A new session then needs a fresh authorized trigger.

The watchdog starts once from a change to `.github/one-off-test.trigger` or by manual workflow dispatch. It does not continuously chain workflows or run on a timer.

## One-time Playit setup (required before public sessions)

1. Generate a Playit Docker agent secret key:
   https://playit.gg/account/setup/wizard/new-account/docker/docker-name
2. In this repository, open **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**.
3. Add the secret:
   - Name: `PLAYIT_SECRET_KEY`
   - Value: the generated Playit Docker agent key.
4. In the Playit dashboard, create a **UDP** tunnel for this agent:
   - Local/origin address: `127.0.0.1`
   - Local/origin port: `27015`
5. Keep the key secret. Do not put it in repository files or chat.

Playit's official agent Docker instructions: https://github.com/playit-cloud/playit-agent#docker

## Start and monitor

After adding `PLAYIT_SECRET_KEY` and configuring the UDP tunnel once, the watchdog can start from a change to `.github/one-off-test.trigger` or by using **Actions → CS 1.6 self-healing session (GitHub-hosted) → Run workflow**.

A successful run must show:
- ReHLDS version and GoldSrc protocol startup.
- ReUnion status `RUN`.
- The map reaching `Round_Start`.
- Playit agent container remaining active.

Then use the public hostname and port assigned in the Playit dashboard to connect from a real CS 1.6 client on a separate Internet connection.

The Playit tunnel is not considered verified until an external player has joined successfully.

## Player capacity

Start with 20 slots. Increase to 32 only after 20 real clients have joined and the runner remains stable. A `+maxplayers 32` setting is only a slot limit, not proof of performance.

## Public status page

https://cs16-community-status.vercel.app/

The page is live and currently reports `PREPARING`. It will remain that way until an external Playit connection is tested and the status data is updated. The static page does not itself query the game server.

## Security

- Never commit RCON passwords, Steam credentials, or the Playit agent key.
- A fresh random RCON password is generated during every session.
- ReHLDS binds to loopback; public traffic is expected through the Playit UDP tunnel.
- Use only server/game files that you are authorized to use.
